- So Michael, if all of the good stuff is in both languages, then why not just pick one?  I can think of at least 3 reasons why...
- First, if you're looking for good data science candidates to build out your team, limiting your search to only candidates who know one language or the other can slow your hiring process
- Second, once in awhile, I *will* run into a problem I'm trying to solve where one language has the perfect package and the other doesn't
- Lastly, I work at a consulting firm, and the fact that we can offer our clients the option to *choose* the language they want us to build the solution in is huge
